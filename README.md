## Generations

The Opel Corsa-e is the all-electric version of the Corsa, first introduced with the sixth generation of the Corsa (Corsa F):

- **First Generation (2019-2023)**: Introduced as part of the Corsa F platform, the first generation Corsa-e was Opel's first mass-produced all-electric vehicle. It featured a 50 kWh battery pack with a WLTP range of up to 209 miles (336 km). The electric motor produced 136 hp (100 kW) and 260 Nm of torque, allowing a 0-62 mph (0-100 km/h) time of 8.1 seconds. This generation was built on PSA Group's CMP platform, following Opel's acquisition by PSA (now part of Stellantis).

- **Second Generation (2023-present)**: The facelifted Corsa-e brought a more efficient electric powertrain with an upgraded 51 kWh battery increasing the range to 222 miles (357 km). This update featured refreshed styling, improved infotainment systems with enhanced connectivity features, and more advanced driver assistance systems. The electric motor remained at 136 hp, but efficiency improvements helped extend the overall driving range.
