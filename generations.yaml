    description: "The Vauxhall/Opel Corsa-e represents the fully electric variant of the sixth-generation Corsa supermini (Corsa F), the first developed under PSA Group (now Stellantis) ownership after the acquisition of Vauxhall/Opel from General Motors. Built on the Stellantis CMP (Common Modular Platform) architecture designed to accommodate multiple powertrain types, the Corsa-e shares its fundamental electric drivetrain with other Stellantis group vehicles including the Peugeot e-208. Visually similar to the conventional petrol and diesel Corsa models but with subtle distinctive elements including unique alloy wheel designs, model-specific blue accents, and 'e' badging, the Corsa-e maintains the sixth-generation Corsa's more restrained styling compared to some competitors. Powered by a 136 horsepower (100 kW) electric motor driving the front wheels and drawing energy from a 50 kWh battery pack, the Corsa-e delivers a WLTP-rated range of approximately 209 miles (337 km) on a full charge. DC fast charging at up to 100 kW allows for an 80% charge in about 30 minutes. Performance is sprightly with 0-62 mph acceleration in 8.1 seconds, actually making it the quickest model in the Corsa lineup. The interior maintains the conventional Corsa's layout with a driver-oriented cockpit featuring a 7-inch or optional 10-inch touchscreen infotainment system, digital instrument cluster, and intuitive physical controls for essential functions. Three driving modes (Eco, Normal, and Sport) allow users to prioritize range or performance as needed. Standard equipment is generous across all trim levels, including automatic climate control, navigation, and multiple driver assistance systems."

    description: "The facelifted Vauxhall/Opel Corsa-e was unveiled on 24 May 2023, featuring a comprehensive update to the sixth-generation Corsa F platform. The exterior redesign introduces Opel's new 'Visor' front end design language, giving the Corsa-e a more distinctive and modern appearance with a bold single-piece grille treatment and refined lighting elements. Inside, the facelift brings a new steering wheel design, updated seat designs with improved comfort and support, and a new gear shifter for automatic transmission variants. Technology upgrades include an enhanced infotainment system with improved connectivity features, larger touchscreen options, and advanced driver assistance systems. The Corsa-e continues to utilize the proven 50 kWh battery pack and 136 horsepower (100 kW) electric motor, though efficiency improvements may extend the real-world range. In December 2023, Opel expanded the Corsa lineup with 48V mild-hybrid versions, though the fully electric Corsa-e remains the flagship zero-emission model. The facelift represents Vauxhall/Opel's commitment to keeping their electric supermini competitive in an increasingly crowded market while maintaining the practical range and accessible price point that made the original successful."
